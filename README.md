# NodeRPIBot
For a school project, I was asked to build a robot. So, I got a spare raspberry pi, installed a few motors on it, and made it controllable via NodeJS. The robot includes the ability to stream video and audio from its on board camera (a Playstation Eye) and to be controlled through a web panel (thanks to almighty web sockets).
